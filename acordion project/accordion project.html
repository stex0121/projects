            <div class="text">
                C++ is a powerful general-purpose programming language that builds upon the syntax and features of the C programming language while adding additional capabilities, especially in terms of object-oriented programming (OOP). It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s and has since become widely used in various domains.
