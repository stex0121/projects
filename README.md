# RTX Genesis Saga & Sapphire Legacy Saga  
**Unlocking retro games with modern & legacy GPU magic!**

This project explores how **NVIDIA RTX 2060** and **Sapphire Vapor-X (AMD Radeon HD 7970)** GPUs, combined with their control panels, can enhance graphics and performance on classic games through emulators.

From **SEGA Genesis classics** to other retro consoles, I compare driver-level tweaks and emulator settings to bring out the best visuals and smoothest gameplay — proving old and new GPUs both have their place in the retro revival.

Join me on this journey of **graphics enhancement, nostalgic gaming, and GPU mastery!**

Now, I’m unleashing the 384-bit Sapphire Vapor-X, an old-school GPU powerhouse with insane raw memory bandwidth.

Will raw muscle beat modern tech? Can this vintage beast deliver next-level pixel perfection on retro emulators?

Get ready for epic side-by-side tests, jaw-dropping visuals, and GPU tweaks you never knew you needed.

This is old vs. new like you’ve never seen before.

Stay tuned. It’s about to get wild.
