# RTX Genesis Saga & Sapphire Legacy Saga  
**Unlocking retro games with modern & legacy GPU magic!**

This project explores how **NVIDIA RTX 2060** and **Sapphire Vapor-X (AMD Radeon HD 7970)** GPUs, combined with their control panels, can enhance graphics and performance on classic games through emulators.

From **SEGA Genesis classics** to other retro consoles, I compare driver-level tweaks and emulator settings to bring out the best visuals and smoothest gameplay â€” proving old and new GPUs both have their place in the retro revival.

Join me on this journey of **graphics enhancement, nostalgic gaming, and GPU mastery!**
