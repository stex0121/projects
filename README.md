Happy coding.
These days i will make content about Atari games.
or better idea i to want to see how older, higher-memory-bus GPUs like Sapphire Vapor-x 384-bit card handle these retro emulator enhancements
Genesis emulator on  Sapphire Vapor-X. Compare it side-by-side with the RTX 2060. You may be surprised by what the older beast can still do with the right driver settings.
